# TP2

A new Flutter project.

## How to use

```
git clone https://github.com/antoineillien/amse.git
cd amse/tp2
flutter create .
flutter run 
```
## Code structure

- **main.dart :**  
*launch the app*
- **home/details.dart :**  
*Displays a scrollable list of exercises + supports the code of ex1*


- **pages/ex2 :**  
*Transform an image*

- **pages/ex4 :**  
*Displays a tile from an image*

- **pages/ex5_1 :**  
*Generate some tiles*

- **pages/ex5_2 :**  
*Generate multiple tiles from an image*

- **pages/ex5_2 :**  
*Allow the user to modify the size of tiles*

The images needed for this app are stored on my github, which allows me to make sure that they will stay available, while making it easier for me to manage them (when compared to local files) + my sandboxing parameters on my linux OS make accessing local ressources hazardous sometimes .
