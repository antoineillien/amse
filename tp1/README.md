# MetaLink

MetaLink is a companion app for when you're wandering the Metaverse. It helps you keep track of your friends, and display their avatars and biography. 
The biographies of all the characters in this app were generated by OpenAI GPT-3, trough an API request.

## Notes

Using Network Images stored on my github allows me to modify these images without having to update the code of the app, while being assured that they will stay accessible. 

The "Jump in the metaverse" button has been neutralized for the moment, as the dependencies needed didn't support null safety. It was possible to run the app but only with the following command : "flutter run --no-sound-null-safety"

The button was suppose to directly open Decentraland via this link : https://play.decentraland.org/ , the code is still available in homescreen.dart .
