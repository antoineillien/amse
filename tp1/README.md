# MetaLink

MetaLink is a companion app built with Flutter for when you're wandering the Metaverse. It helps you keep track of your friends, and display their avatars and biography. 
The biographies of all the characters in this app were generated by OpenAI GPT-3, trough an API request.

## Improvement

Aside from improving the UI, I would have add a filter and search widget on the friends list, and a way to add friends.

## Code structure

- **main.dart :**  
*launch the app*
- **pages/details.dart :**  
*Displays details about each friend from the database*
- **pages/friendslist.dart :**  
*Displays a scrollable and clickable list of all registered friends*
- **pages/about.dart :**  
*Displays infos about me*
- **pages/home.dart :**  
*Displays the homescreen page of the app*
- **pages/homescreen.dart :**  
*Allows the navigation between the homepage, the friends list, and the "about" page*
- **items/friends.dart :**  
*Contains the class of the friends object, called "ami", all of the infos of each friend, and the builder of the listview*

The images needed for this app are stored on my github, which allows me to make sure that they will stay available, while making it easier for me to manage them (when compared to local files).

Metaverse is a fraud.
